								<!-- <h2>AI-Integrated Clincal Testing</h2>
								<p>As given in the synopsis <a href="/assets/documents/IntroductionToPersonalizedMedicine.pdf">here</a>, We will be using AI, in the drug testing cycle and in the consumption of medicines for the end user.<o</p> -->
								<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
								<p>With current RCTs, we get an idea of how a vaccine/drug will work for the average person, but it <b>can not</b> give an idea for a specific person. Genetic Minorities are the ones most affected by this.</p>
								<h2>How do we know genetic minorities are affected and that genes play a part?</h2>
								<p>Refer <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594139/pdf/jnma00329-0002.pdf">this</a> study on how minorities are affected in healthcare.</p>
								<h2>But Can Machine Learning predict such advanced things?</h2>
								<p>Yes, it can. Refer <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062420/pdf/khvi-16-02-1697110.pdf">this</a> study on how AI can predict the effect of vaccines on people.</p>
								<h2>What Machine Learning Models are being used?</h2>
								<p>Currently, we have the provision to use KNN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Adaboost and Decision tree Regressor. Plans to add advanced neural networks are also in the process. Refer <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062420/pdf/khvi-16-02-1697110.pdf">this</a> study which recommends some of these models.</p>
								<h2>Alright, But how will we approach this?</h2>
								<p>First, we gather volunteers. Machine Learning always works better when there is more data available. Next, we collect their DNA data and test the drug/vaccine on them. We then map the DNA(not the whole but the parts corresponding to the drug's effect) with the drug/medicine's efficiency. Then we take a few genetic samples from various people and then test the Machine learning model and see if any results are bad/below the expected margin. We then find what exact genetic change causes this and develop a variation. We use this data to create a variation that performs better for the genetic minority. We repeat this process until we achieve the maximum precision possible for the most number of people. </p>
								<h2>What about the patients? Won't they get confused if there are so many variations?</h2>
								<p>To combat this problem an interface has been designed where a user can upload their genetic data and it shall automatically find the optimal variation for the person.</p>
