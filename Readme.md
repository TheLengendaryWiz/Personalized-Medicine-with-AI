# Personalized Medicine

This is a personal project. This is an attempt to create a working personalized medicine system interface using AI. Hopefully this will be useful in the field of medicine.

## Running the project
First, you need to install the dependencies and change the backend url in /public/DDI/index.html and /public/EUI/index.html. Then, you need to run the server. Make sure to install the follwing dependencies:  

`pip install flask`  
`pip install flask-cors`  
`pip install sklearn`  
`pip install waitress`  
[Note: waitress is optional]

Then, you can run the server and test the frontend.  
[Note: I've deployed the frontend on firebase so ignore the firebase.json file]

## Credits
Thanks to Stellar Template by HTML5 UP for the frontend.
